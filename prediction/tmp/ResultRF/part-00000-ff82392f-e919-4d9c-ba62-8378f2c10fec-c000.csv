The Chevy Volt does not save you on maintenance. Infact its been made more complex with EV/ICE combo. GM does not want to commit to the EV market. They just add it to the product mix to reduce the overall emission numbers in California and other states. They will not push those sales once their numbers are met as they EVs they develop lose money for them. There is a reason why Tesla is disrupting the dealer model with a direct sales models. And so far its working for them. There will be EVs coming not from traditional ICE car  companies but from Tech companies. These are now computers on wheel. Traditional car companies will struggle to adapt and its a huge shift for them. I know why you would think this is wishful thinking,0.0

The thing I'm digging at is that these isolated events do not justify the whole. If we discovered a burning bush like Moses saw in the Bible then many would see that as justification for the Bible being literally true. But in reality that would just point to a burning-bush phenomena in the desert. Maybe it has some correlation to the Bible. But that's not logical to say it justifies the whole. Much of religious doctrine is built this way. This bible verse justifies that one and so on. The Bible doesn't actually work this way,0.0

The 747 carried a fire extinguishing chemical with it to Chile in late January 2017.  No mixing base was required.  The water/chemical mix was used in direct attack and extinguished fires where it was dropped.  The chemical is a recipient of the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award.  The chemicals in use cost is about 8% of the in use cost of retardant and 1/3rd the cost of the cheapest gel.  The chemical/water mix was credited with saving the town of Llico,0.0

The gov could really improve coffers by requiring NO cell phone use _period_ by any driver while behind wheel moving. Ive suggested this to some Legislature members. It would greatly increase revenue and is an essential reason why we need more police on roads in this anomalous part of history. It is insane to drive while talking on a cell.

Not true.  Unless otherwise posted right turn on red after full stop is legal here.  Left turn on red after full stop from the left lane of a one way street onto a one way street is also legal here.

Scientists have tried to find some link between hunting and reduction in the size of horns or antlers. It’s more complicated than you might think. The sheep with the largest horns isn’t necessarily the biggest or smartest ram in the band. And there is certainly evidence that the ram who exerts his dominance over other rams doesn’t do all the breeding. When you claim that hunting full-curl rams is “taking the best out of the herd” you are forgetting the ewes,0.0

I do not support sanctuary cities.  Providing a welcome sign just leads to and supports open undocumented entry.  If someone doesn't even follow the refugee process they have no right being here or asking for services.  We ensure refugees are safe and have their needs met.  In fact by providing services to undocumented individuals we are supporting an underground economy and allowing such individuals and more importantly their children to be taken advantage of and abused or worse.  True refugees would get the approval and support they need.  Likely undocumented individual are economic migrants or individuals that have criminal backgrounds.

Mr. Verleger said either a border-adjustment tax or a crude-import tax would hit the Canadian industry hard,0.0
I think I'm missing something here. Canada would only be at a competitive disadvantage if US needs could be met entirely by domestic production and Canadian producers were forced to compete in the US market place. Since the US doesn't produce enough it has to import. Slapping on a border adjustment tax would hit all oil imports equally which would only serve to drive up the cost of oil in the US. There would be no reason for Canadian producers to reduce pricing to offset the cost of the border adjustment tax,0.0

The lack of a father figure and the reliance on the gang culture for that male role model is one of the major reasons for this violence.

Women are being taught that they not only do not need to have a father involved for financial reasons,0.0

People don't seem to understand that it will create more traffic and increase taxes on our children & grandchildren for the next 50 years or until they tear it down. The maintenance is going to be horrendous & the operational costs will be a gift to the Unions at the tax payers expense. The only WIN AT THIS POINT is to use the existing elevated guide way as a reversible highway for all Leeward residents to use every day rather than less then 2% of mostly present BUS riders. Our Mayor & City Council just raise Taxes and fees without thinking about the cost of living in Hawaii.

The politics of unions is well established.  Right leaning government cannot ban them outright.  Canadians as free people with freedom of speech and fraternite have a fundamental moral right to organize and meet together as a union.  But governments can most assuredly remove a lot of the instruments foolishly put in place to give unions too much power.  Government can and should enact laws guaranteeing their right to hire replacement workers with ease and without consequences when contracts end.  And they can and should enact laws allowing employees to opt out of paying the union dues,0.0

Another concern I have is for individuals who actually need opioid medications so that they can function on a day-to-day basis. I recently had a client who needs this medication. His former provider had moved away and he needs to find a new one. He was referred to both pain clinics and general practitioners. Every single one he called said that if he needs opioid medication they would not consider him as a patient without even getting basic information on his medical condition.  This is not someone who abuses these meds,0.0
